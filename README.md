## Customer Personality Analysis

**Dataset source:**

**About the project:** The project was performed by a team of 4 people and consists of creating a Marketing Campaign to a online Grocery store implementing machine learning on a dataset collected over a 2-year period including the profiling of customers, products they bought,
amount spent, when was their last visit and what channel was used to purchase (online, store, catalogue, etc...). By analyzing the data we could identify spending patterns, understand customer behaviour and by implementing clustering models be able to improve
marketing campaings by targeting the right customers.
